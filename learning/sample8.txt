Safety Tips: Ingredients to Avoid
 Some ingredients have more risk of harming you or the environment than others and should 
be avoided. If you decide to use a retail product, read the labels and try to choose products 
that don’t have the harmful chemicals shown here in this table. If that’s not possible, then 
use extreme care - wear gloves and goggles, have a good supply of fresh air, and keep 
children and pets safely away.

Safety Tips: At Home and After Use
 When using any cleaning product, be 
sensible about protecting yourself from 
harmful effects of chemicals. Even the 
“safer” products discussed in this guide 
can irritate your skin and burn your eyes  
if you’re not careful. 
At Home 
Request the Material Safety Data Sheet 
(MSDS) by calling the (800) customer 
service number on the label, or check  
the internet for MSDS information.  
www.ilpi.com/msds
 Use only the prescribed amount - more  
is not always better. 
Use products in well-ventilated areas. 
Breathing too much of products such as 
chlorine, drain cleaner, oven cleaner, or 
solvents can irritate the skin, lungs, eyes, 
and/or cause dizziness. 
Keep children and pets away from where 
you are cleaning to avoid distraction. 
Don’t clean and cook at the same time to 
avoid contamination. 
Wear protective clothing, gloves and 
goggles. When finished, remove protec
tive clothing and wash separately from 
regular clothing. 
Use extreme care when using toxic 
or caustic products. Follow the safety 
precautions printed on the label without 
exception, particularly with respect to the 
use of protective clothing, gloves, and 
goggles and maintaining good ventilation.
 Never mix products containing chlorine 
bleach with those containing ammonia 
or acid. These mixtures create a lethal 
poisonous gas. 
After Use 
Keep lid tightly closed. If a child-resistant 
lid is provided, use it. 
Keep products in original container so you 
know what they are. 
Store products out of reach of children 
and pets, such as in a locked cabinet, and 
not where food is stored. 
Dispose of chemicals at your local 
Household Hazardous Waste Facility. 
Even though the label may instruct you 
to dispose of the product in the trash, 
California has strict rules about what may 
go in the trash. See the Safe Disposal and 
the Drain and Garbage Can’s and Can’ts 
sections for more information.
 Never dump chemicals down storm drains 
or catch basins.

Safe Disposal
 Despite what some product labels say, 
many household products, including 
paints, motor oil, garden products, and 
certain cleaning products, should not be 
disposed of down sinks, in toilets, floor 
drains, or in the garbage. Some household 
products contain toxic pollutants which, 
when disposed of in indoor drains, pass 
through wastewater treatment plants and 
end up in San Francisco Bay and the Pacific 
Ocean, harming fish, aquatic species and 
wildlife. Throwing away household prod
ucts in the garbage can harm garbage

Disposal Guidelines for  
Household Hazardous Waste
 Follow these important guidelines 
when using the Household Hazardous 
Waste services: 
For guidance about what to bring 
to the Household Hazardous Waste 
Facility see the Drain and Garbage 
Can’s and Can’ts section.
 Do not transport more than 5 gallons 
or 50 pounds of hazardous waste 
in your vehicle. State law prohibits 
transportation of larger amounts 
without a license. 
Do not mix products. 
Keep all chemicals in their original 
container. If the original container is 
not available, then label the container 
with its ingredients. 
Make sure lids are sealed tightly. 
Prevent leakage. Pack containers in 
plastic or newspapers and put them 
into a larger container that can hold 
the product if a leak occurs. 
These items cannot be accepted at  
the local facilities: radioactive materials 
(such as smoke alarms), explosives, 
reactive, and pressurized gas cylinders 
over 20 pounds.

Drain and Garbage Can’s and Can’ts
 When in doubt about how to dispose 
of a product, call your local Household 
Hazardous Waste Collection Facility. 
What Can Go Down the Drain 
Homemade cleaning products are safe 
to dispose down the drain without 
risk of chemical, physical, or biological 
harm to plumbing and wastewater 
treatment processes. 
What Can Go in the Garbage 
Any empty and dry container (5 gallons 
or less in capacity) that has no continu
ous flow of liquid is safe to dispose in 
the garbage. 
What Can’t Go Down the Drain 
or in the Garbage 
The following should not be disposed 
down the drain or put in the trash. 
Containers of unwanted products 
should be taken to the Household 
Hazardous Waste Collection Facility: 
Cleaning products (e.g., products 
with words like “toxic”, “corrosive”, 
“flammable”, or “ignitable” mentioned 
on the label) 
Automotive products (e.g., motor oil, 
antifreeze, brake fluids) 
Garden supplies (e.g., pesticides, 
herbicides, fungicides) 
Paints and solvents (e.g., latex and 
oil-based paints, thinners, strippers) - 
Do not clean oil-based paintbrushes 
in the sink 
Art and hobby supplies (e.g., glues, 
photographic chemicals, paints)
