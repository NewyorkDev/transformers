ALL-PURPOSE CLEANERS
 All-purpose cleaners can be used for 
counters, cabinets, stovetops, and other 
general areas. You can make cleaners 
on your own, or purchase safe retail 
cleaners. Always test homemade and 
retail cleaners on a small, hidden area 
to make sure it cleans to your satisfac
tion and doesn’t scratch the surface.
 Safer Methods 
Add 1/4 to 1 teaspoon of vegetable
based dishwashing soap or other 
liquid soap (such as castile soap) to 
8 ounces of water in a spray bottle. 
Spray on surfaces and wipe clean with 
a wet sponge or cloth. Wipe dry. 
Make a solution of 9 parts warm water 
to 1 part white vinegar. Wipe with 
sponge or soft cloth. Make a stronger 
solution for tougher jobs. 
Sprinkle baking soda or mix baking soda 
with water and scrub with a wet sponge. 
If the baking soda leaves a residue, rinse 
with cold water and dilute vinegar. Dry 
with a cloth. 
For stains on counters, squeeze fresh 
lemon juice, let sit for 45 minutes, 
sprinkle baking soda, and rub with 
sponge or soft cloth. 
Look for retail all-purpose cleaning 
products that are not hazardous. 
For example, use products with 
d-limonene (caution if you are allergic 
to citrus), amine oxide or methyl soyate - use with care (keep out of your eyes - 
wear goggles). 
Prevention 
Clean up spills immediately. 
Clean counters and stovetops daily. 
Be careful using abrasive cleansers on 
any surface – especially plastic, glass, 
porcelain, wood, painted surfaces, or 
stainless steel – they may scratch the 
surface and/or remove the finish.

SCOURING CLEANERS
 Some retail scouring cleansers contain 
silica or chlorine bleach. Silica can be 
dangerous if inhaled. Mixing cleansers 
containing chlorine bleach with other 
products containing acids or ammonia 
can create a poisonous gas. You can 
make effective scouring cleansers 
yourself or purchase retail products 
without silica or chlorine. 
Safer Methods 
Sprinkle baking soda or make a paste 
with baking soda and a small amount 
of liquid soap. Scrub with a damp 
white nylon scrubbing pad, soft cloth, 
sponge, or very fine steel wool. Test 
before using to make sure you don’t 
scratch the surface. Rinse with vinegar 
if necessary. Dry with a cloth. 
Retail scouring cleansers are available 
that do not contain silica or chlorine. 
Prevention 
Cleaning regularly helps to prevent 
build-up of grime. 
Be careful using abrasive cleansers on 
any surface - especially plastic, glass, 
or porcelain, wood, painted surfaces, 
or stainless steel - they may scratch  
the surface and/or remove the finish.

GLASS CLEANER
 Glass cleaners range from mild 
detergents to heavy-duty products 
with strong solvents. Some retail 
products are mists or aerosols,  
which are unhealthy to breathe. For  
aerosols, you end up paying extra  
just for the propellants. Water or  
dilute white vinegar is just as  
effective, if not better, than most  
retail glass cleaners on the market. 
Safer Methods 
For routine window cleaning, apply 
water with a soft cloth, squeegee dry, 
and rub with newspaper for a streak
free window (wear gloves to prevent 
ink from blackening hands). 
If the windows are really dirty, mix  
¼ cup white vinegar with water in a 
quart spray bottle. Use a white nylon 
scrubbing pad for stubborn dirt. 
Finish by rubbing with newspaper for 
a streak-free window (wear gloves to 
prevent ink from blackening hands).
 To remove greasy fingerprints, put 
1-tablespoon reconstituted (or strained 
fresh) lemon juice with warm water in a 
quart spray bottle. 
Try products containing amine oxide, 
mild detergents, white vinegar, or 
similar lower toxicity ingredients.  
(Keep out of your eyes - wear goggles). 
Prevention 
Streaking is often a sign that the 
window cleaning product is too strong. 
Try adding a little water.
 Do not clean windows in direct sun
light as this can also cause streaks.

dow products that repel dirt? Search 
the web for ‘self-cleaning glass’.

KITCHEN CLEANERS
 You can do most kitchen cleaning 
with homemade glass and all
purpose cleaner. To remove stubborn 
countertop rings or spots, use a mild 
scouring cleanser. 
Safer Methods 
Homemade glass cleaner or general 
purpose cleaner works well on 
chrome, porcelain, stainless steel,  
and other kitchen surfaces. See 
the Glass Cleaner and All-Purpose 
Cleaners sections.
 Use liquid kitchen cleaners contain
ing amine oxide, mild detergents, or 
methyl soyate. 
To disinfect, usually soap and hot water 
will do the trick. To kill mold or fungus, 
use ¼ cup white vinegar in 1 gallon of 
cold water. 
To remove stubborn countertop rings 
or spots, sprinkle baking soda or make 
a paste with baking soda and a small 
amount of liquid soap. Scrub with a 
damp white nylon scrubbing pad, soft 
cloth, sponge, or very fine steel wool. 
Test before using this method to make 
sure you don’t scratch the surface. 
Rinse with white vinegar if necessary. 
Dry with a cloth.
 Prevention 
Cleaning regularly prevents grime 
build-up.
 Install a plastic or glass backsplash 
around your stove and food prepara
tion counters.

OVENS
 Most retail oven cleaners contain 
sodium hydroxide, or lye, one of 
the most dangerous substances for 
household use. Sodium hydroxide 
mists can blind you, burn your nose 
and mouth, and damage your lungs. 
Safer Methods 
For lightly soiled ovens, make a 
thick paste with water and baking 
soda. Scrub well with a white nylon 
scrubbing pad. If the oven is greasy, 
add a small amount of liquid soap. 
To remove spots, use very fine steel 
wool or a plastic scraper. Rubbing 
gently with a wet cleaning pumice bar 
will remove the toughest spots and  
will not scratch the surface. Retail  
oven cleaners are available that are  
non-caustic and do not contain lye. 
Avoid products with the word 
“Danger” on the label.
 Prevention 
Preventing spills is the easiest and saf
est way to keep your oven clean - catch 
drips by placing aluminum foil or a 
metal tray underneath. 
Spills are easier to clean up if they are 
attacked before getting baked on. 
Clean the oven regularly.
