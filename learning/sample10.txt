DRAINS
 Prevention is the key to keeping drains 
from becoming plugged. It is easier 
and more sensible than waiting for 
a crisis, and much safer than using 
chemical drain openers. 
Safer Methods 
For clogged drains, use a plunger or 
snake. Before using a plunger, be sure 
there is water standing over the drain. 
To get an airtight fit, apply petroleum 
jelly on rim. Push and pull vigorously. 
When using a snake, first remove all 
strainers or cross bars. Gently rotate 
snake and when resistance is felt, 
withdraw material carefully. 
For roots in pipes, contact a plumber or 
root removal specialist to mechanically 
remove the roots. Be sure to tell service 
providers that you want mechanical 
removal, not chemical removal.
 Prevention 
Put a strainer or filter in all drains. 
Never pour any type of grease down 
your drains because it can can harden 
and clog your pipes. 
Scrape or wipe grease and food scraps 
from dishes into the garbage or com
post bin (or kitchen scrap recycling bin 
where available) before washing dishes. 
After cooking, pour any grease or oil 
directly into a can or jar and:
 •	For grease that is a liquid at room 
temperature (such as vegetable oil 
from a fryer), see www.baywise.org 
for local disposal drop-off sites.
 •	For grease that solidifies at 
room temperature (such as bacon 
grease), toss the container in your 
garbage can. 
Avoid using the garbage disposal. 
Food scraps often contain grease, 
which can harden and clog the 
plumbing after passing through the 
garbage disposal. 
Once a week, put a handful of baking 
soda down the drain followed by 
boiling water.
 Woody vegetation should be planted 
away from sewer lines to prevent 
blockages from roots.

BATHROOMS
 Bathroom cleaners are designed 
especially to deal with soap scum and 
mildew on tubs, tiles, and showers. 
Many retail bathroom cleaners are 
also disinfectants, which temporarily 
kill germs on surfaces. Use the mildest 
product that meets your standards. 
Safer Methods 
To clean the sink, shower, tub, and tile 
grout, soak the area with diluted liquid 
soap, then sprinkle with baking soda 
and scrub with a white nylon scrubbing 
pad and rinse. Use a stiff toothbrush or 
scrub brush for tiles. Rinse any residue 
with dilute white vinegar and cold water. 
To remove rust stains on porcelain or 
tile rub gently with pumice stone. 
To clean mold from surfaces, use a 
mixture of 1-teaspoon of borax in a 
quart of hot water in a spray bottle. 
Wipe with a damp cloth or sponge. 
To remove soap scum from glass shower 
doors, rub surfaces with Borax or di
luted liquid soap and baking soda, and 
scrub with a white nylon scrubbing pad. 
For serious soap scum, use very fine 
steel wool. Rinse with cold water and,  
if necessary, add white vinegar to rinse. 
To disinfect, spray or wipe with  
white vinegar. 
Prevention 
Bacteria, mildew, and mold generally 
cannot live without dampness, so keep 
surfaces dry by frequent wiping (use a 
squeegee in the shower) and keeping 
the bathroom well-ventilated. 
Clean the bathroom frequently.

TOILET BOWLS
 You may not need a special cleaner 
just for the toilet. Baking soda or a 
non-chlorine scouring powder should 
do the job. Toilet bowls generally don’t 
stay germ-free for long no matter what 
you use. 
Safer Methods 
To clean, scrub with baking soda  
and/or liquid soap, or non-chlorine 
scouring powder. 
To remove stains, pour 1/4 cup of 
borax into bowl and let sit for at least 
30 minutes or overnight. Scrub bowl 
well and then flush. 
To remove mineral deposits, scrub 
with bar of cleaning pumice. (Test for 
scratching before cleaning.) 
To clean exterior toilet area, spray with 
liquid soap diluted in water. Check 
under toilet tank and all crevices. 
Dry with a cloth. For heavy dirt, see 
Scouring Cleansers.
 To disinfect an area, put white vinegar 
in a spray bottle. Apply and wipe clean. 
Prevention 
Clean the toilet frequently, perhaps 
weekly or more. Even if you purchase 
cleaners, the bowl won’t stay germ
free for long. Frequent, thorough 
cleaning is the key no matter what 
cleaner you use.

CARPETS
 Carpets need step-wise cleaning: 
frequent vacuuming, spot cleaning for 
spills, and occasional steam cleaning 
for removing deeper soil and dust. This 
approach is good for upholstery, too. 
Avoid commercial spot removers 
with perchloroethylene. 
Safer Methods 
Vacuuming - Dirt accumulates just 
inside doorways, next to furnace cold 
air returns, and in closed rooms. Spend 
extra time vacuuming these areas. 
Spills - Wipe up quickly before the stain 
becomes permanent. Use a dry rag or 
paper towel to soak up the spill. The 
next step depends on what was spilled: 
Using water on a rag may remove the 
rest of the stain. Avoid warm or hot 
water, as these may set the stain.
 Tackle oil or grease with your general 
purpose cleaner; sprinkle baking soda 
on any greasy residue to help absorb it, 
wait 10 minutes and then vacuum.
 Cover red wine spill completely with 
salt to soak up the wine, then blot 
with a towel soaked in cold water and 
repeat as needed. 
For tough stains, pet waste and 
ketchup, remove any solids with blunt 
edged tool, and blot liquids with a 
dry cloth. Mix a teaspoon of mild 
detergent in a cup of water and then 
sponge the area with this mixture. 
Blot again with a clean, dry cloth. To 
remove odors, spray with a 1:3 parts 
white vinegar to water solution, and 
then blot again.  
To remove room odors, sprinkle baking 
soda on the carpet, let stand for a few 
minutes then vacuum.
 Steam Cleaning - There are now many 
environmentally-friendly commercial 
cleaning services. Ask what solvents 
or chemicals the company uses before 
hiring the service provider. Make sure 
to avoid service providers that use 
percloroethylene.
 Prevention 
Prevent dirt from being tracked into 
the house by placing mats in doorways. 
Vacuum frequently.

FLOORS
 Floor care products include dust  
mop sprays, liquid cleaners, and  
f
 inish restorers. Many retail products 
contain chemicals that have significant 
health and environmental impacts.  
You can look for safer products, or 
make your own.
 Safer Methods 
Mop vinyl or real linoleum with a 
diluted white vinegar solution. Use a 
stronger solution for tougher jobs. 
To cut grease on vinyl floors, dilute a 
small amount of liquid soap with water. 
Mop then rinse with a diluted white 
vinegar solution. 
For sealed wood floors, damp 
mop with diluted white vinegar or 
vegetable-based liquid soap and  
water. Do not use a wet mop, as you 
may cause damage to the wood.  
Dry immediately with a cloth.
 To remove black heel marks on floors, 
rub with a pencil or typewriter eraser. 
Prevention 
Sweep or vacuum floors frequently to 
eliminate the need for using chemicals. 
Scrub floors regularly. 
Use area rugs to protect the floor. 
Prevent dirt from being tracked into the 
house by placing foot mats at doorways.

FURNITURE
 Rather than adding another special
purpose cleaner to the clutter under 
your sink, it’s far less expensive to use 
a rag or sponge moistened with water 
and a little all-purpose cleaner or even 
a plain damp rag to clean your finished 
furniture. Before using any product 
or homemade cleaner, test a small 
inconspicuous area first to see if  
results are satisfactory. 
Expensive antiques and teak 
furniture may require special  
care – consult an expert. 
Safer Methods 
To dust, wipe along the grain with a 
soft cloth or vacuum dust with a soft 
brush attachment. 
To clean most spills and fingerprints, 
rub with a soft cloth, lightly moistened 
with water and a small amount of 
vegetable-based liquid soap. Buff 
immediately with a soft dry cloth, 
removing any residual water. 
For dirtier surfaces, moisten a soft 
cloth with a small amount of vegeta
ble-based liquid soap or all-purpose 
cleaner diluted in water. You can also 
mix 1 tsp white vinegar in 1 cup white 
vinegar in a spray bottle and wipe 
clean. Buff immediately with a soft dry 
cloth, removing any residual moisture. 
To polish most wood surfaces, mix 
equal parts vegetable or olive oil with 
white vinegar. Apply small amounts of 
the mixture with a soft, dry cloth. Buff 
to shine. 
Prevention 
Dust frequently - regular dusting helps 
to prevent dirt from accumulating.

METAL POLISHES
 Retail metal cleaners and polishes can 
vary widely in the hazards they pose. 
Try the safer methods listed below. 
Safer Methods 
For copper and brass, saturate a 
sponge or soft cloth with white vinegar 
or lemon juice, sprinkle salt on sponge 
and rub or make a paste by adding 
white flour. Rinse thoroughly and dry, 
otherwise it will corrode rapidly. 
For silver, rub gently with toothpaste 
(paste, not gel). Rinse with warm water, 
then dry with a soft cloth. 
For chrome, wipe with diluted white 
vinegar. Rinse with water, then dry. To 
clean oily stains on chrome, wipe with 
a small amount of liquid soap first, fol
lowed by diluted white vinegar. Polish 
with dry cloth. 
For stainless steel, mix baking soda with 
water and clean. You can also add a 
small amount of liquid soap. Rinse with 
diluted white vinegar, buff with a dry 
cloth. Mineral deposits in tea kettles 
can be dissolved by filling with white 
vinegar, allowing to soak, and rinsing. 
Prevention 
Store silver behind glass, in cloth or 
plastic bags, or plastic wrap. Do not 
wrap silver with rubber bands because 
they can discolor the silver.
