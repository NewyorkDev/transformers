Use this Guide for a Clean Home and a Clean Bay!
 You don’t need harsh chemical clean
ing products to clean your home. 
Common household products like 
baking soda and white vinegar are 
good all-purpose cleaners. 
There are very good reasons to make 
the switch - some retail cleaning prod
ucts can be hazardous to your health 
and the health of your family and pets. 
The hazards can come from chemical 
fumes, improper mixing of more than 
one product, or from children or pets 
ingesting the products. 
In addition, some chemicals in prod
ucts disposed of down the drain may 
end up in San Francisco Bay and the 
Pacific Ocean. The resulting “chemical 
soup” can adversely affect aquatic 
creatures, and contribute to the build 
up of toxins in the fish we eat. 

Getting Started
 Switching to safer cleaning products is simple. Just incorporate the cleaning 
products and tools listed on the following pages into your regular household 
cleaning methods.  
Here are some tips for getting started:  
•	Evaluate the cleaning products 
you already have. Use them up, if 
appropriate, or follow the safe dis
posal methods listed in this guide. 
•	Get organized. Gather all of your 
supplies, like baking soda and 
white vinegar. Check the Shopping 
List and Tools sections in this guide 
for other items you may need. 
•	Test tools, techniques, and prod
ucts in a small, inconspicuous area 
f
 irst to see if results are satisfactory.  
•	If there are children or pets in your 
home, set up a safe, secure storage 
place for hazardous materials. 
•	Ask your school-age children to 
help you evaluate and select the 
least toxic cleaning products - it 
may make a good science project 
for them

Cleaning Tips
 The more frequently you clean, the 
less effort it will take, because cleaning 
more frequently will help prevent 
dirt, harmful bacteria and mold from 
building up. In addition, frequent 
cleaning helps keep pests such as  
ants and roaches under control. 
Consider the following tips: 
Frequently: Wash dishes, clean 
kitchen sink, counters, and stovetops. 
Wipe showers after each use. Sweep  
or vacuum floors and carpets. 
Regularly: Wash hard surface floors. 
Dust furniture. Clean bathroom sink, 
bathtub, shower, and toilet. 
Occasionally: Wash windows. Clean 
refrigerator, kitchen cabinets, garbage 
can, and oven. 
Immediately: Clean up spills - the 
longer you leave the spill the more 
the spill will set and stain. Use a cloth 
or sponge to absorb spills on carpets, 
rugs, and furniture, then swab or wipe 
the spill with a damp cloth. 
Use the right cleaning tools and keep 
them in good working order. 
Don’t mix cleaning products and  
tools - use one sponge for toilets,  
and another for sinks and showers. 
Wash rags, sponges, and brushes 
in the clothes washer once a week. 
Bacteria collect quickly in cleaning 
tools, so it’s very important to wash 
them regularly. 

Homemade Cleaning Products
 You can make cleaning products using 
basic ingredients such as baking soda 
and lemon juice, with recipes and tips 
provided in this guide. Additional 
recipes for homemade cleaning 
products can be found in various 
websites and home product books 
listed in the Resources section. 
When making and using safer cleaning 
products, keep these important points 
in mind: 
Homemade products should be 
labeled to identify the ingredients 
in your mixture. Never use food 
and drink containers for mixtures, 
as this is a common cause of 
accidental poisoning. 
Mixtures should always be kept in a 
child-resistant container and out of 
reach of children and pets, such as in 
locked cabinets, and not where food  
is stored. 
Avoid using dairy products, such 
as mayonnaise or milk, for cleaning 
purposes because they may 
encourage bacterial growth and  
cause health risks. 
When using a product, test a small 
inconspicuous area first to see if  
results are satisfactory. 

Shopping List
 The following are basic ingredients for 
making homemade cleaners. See the 
Cleaning Tools section for other items 
you may wish to purchase. Now, there 
are also many retail products that claim 
to be environmentally friendly – make 
sure to check the Safety Tips: Buying 
Retail Cleaning Products section to 
choose wisely. 
Store all homemade and retail 
cleaners out of reach of children 
and pets. Don’t store retail cleaning 
products where food is stored!
